# Understat_scraping_project
This repository holds the relevant understat.com data for all seasons from 2014- present for all the players and teams they play for. The data available is for English Premier League only. As those were the only data I needed for a separate project I am doing. Regardless, if anybody needs data for other leagues as well, raise an issue, I will try to add them as well.
